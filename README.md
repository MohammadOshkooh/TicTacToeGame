*** Project Overview 
This project is a server-client and peer-to-peer (P2P) application that manages user registrations, logins, and connections, allowing users to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe over a network. The server handles user management and connection requests, while the client manages individual user sessions and the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The project also includes P2P capabilities for direct communication between clients.

*** Project Description
The project consists of three main components:

Server: Manages user data, handles registration and login requests, and manages connections between users.
Client: Manages individual user sessions, connects to the server, and handles Tic-Tac-Toe game interactions.
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Connections: Allows direct communication between clients for playing Tic-Tac-Toe.
Goals
Implement a simple user management system with registration and login functionality.
Allow users to connect to each other and play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
Ensure communication between clients and the server using socket programming.
Implement P2P communication for direct client-to-client interactions.
Requirements
Python 3.x
